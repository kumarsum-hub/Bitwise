# Motion Sensing on the STM32L4 IoT Node

This example shows how to create a a simple motion sensing application
to recognize human activities using machine learning on an STM32 microcontroller.

## Creating your own application
Instructions on how to create your own STM32 microcontroller application detailed in the wiki article:
